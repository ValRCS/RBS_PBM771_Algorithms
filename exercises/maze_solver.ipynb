    "## Mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "Maze is a 2D grid where some cells are blocked and some are open. The objective is to find a path from a start cell to an end cell. The path should not pass through blocked cells. The path can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be variations in the problem. For example, the start and end cells can be given, or the start cell can be given and the end cell can be any open cell. The maze can be given as a 2D array or as a string. The blocked cells can be represented by 0 and open cells by 1, or vice versa."

    "### Programming Exercise: Navigate the Maze\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will develop an algorithm to find the shortest path through a 20x20 maze from a starting point (S) to a goal point (G). The maze is represented by a grid where each cell contains a symbol indicating what is at that position: a wall (X), the start (S), the goal (G), or a digit from 0 to 9 representing the cost of passing through that cell. The cost simulates obstacles such as mud or monsters, with higher values indicating more challenging obstacles.\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a program that reads a 20x20 maze from an input file and outputs the shortest path from S to G, considering the costs associated with each cell. The path's total cost is the sum of the individual costs of all cells traversed, including the start and goal cells. Walls (X) are impassable and must be avoided.\n",
    "#### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The input will be a text file containing a 20x20 grid. Each character in the grid represents a cell in the maze: \n",
    "- **S** : The starting point. \n",
    "- **G** : The goal point. \n",
    "- **X** : An impassable wall. \n",
    "- **0-9** : A passable cell, with the digit representing the cost to pass through that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an input file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "S0123456789X012345678\n",
    "0123456789X0123456789\n",
    "X0X2X4X6X8X0X2X4X6X8\n",
    "01234567890123456789G\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should output the path from S to G with the lowest total cost. The output should include the path's coordinates in row-column format (0-indexed), the sequence of moves, and the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "Path: (0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,2) -> ... -> (19,18)\n",
    "Moves: Right -> Down -> Down -> ... -> Right\n",
    "Total Cost: 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements \n",
    "1. **Functionality** : Your solution must accurately find the shortest path from S to G, taking into account the costs of passing through each cell. \n",
    "2. **Efficiency** : While the primary goal is correctness, consider the efficiency of your algorithm, as the maze is relatively large. \n",
    "3. **Readability** : Write your code in a clear and readable manner, with comments explaining key parts of your algorithm. \n",
    "4. **Input/Output** : Your program should read the maze from a file and output the solution as described above.\n",
    "#### Suggestions\n",
    "- You may use any programming language you are comfortable with.\n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* as they are well-suited for this type of problem.\n",
    "- Consider using a priority queue to manage the nodes you explore based on their current total cost.\n",
    "- Test your algorithm with various mazes to ensure it handles different scenarios correctly.\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your source code file(s) and at least three input maze files along with their corresponding output files. Ensure your submission includes instructions on how to run your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and have fun exploring the maze!\n"
