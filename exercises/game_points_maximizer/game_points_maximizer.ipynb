    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are playing an online game (or arcade) where you have to collect points by moving through a series of levels. Each level has a certain number of points associated with it. You can choose to play any level, but once you play a level, you cannot play the next consecutive level (to avoid overexertion). Your goal is to maximize the total points you can collect without violating this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "An array points of length n where points[i] represents the number of points you can collect from level i.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of points you can collect by playing the levels.\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 less or equal than n less or equal than 1000\n",
    "1 less or equal than p o i n t s not stretchy left square bracket i not stretchy right square bracket less or equal than 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: points = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can collect 3 points from level 0, skip level 1, collect 5 points from level 2, skip level 3, and collect 7 points from level 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total points = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: points = [10, 2, 2, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can collect 10 points from level 0, skip level 1, skip level 2, collect 10 points from level 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total points = 10 + 10 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The problem is analogous to the \"House Robber Problem\" at Leetcode where you can't rob two adjacent houses. Here, you can't play two consecutive levels.\n",
    "* Use a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the maximum points that can be collected from level 0 to level i.\n",
    "* Transition Formula: display style d p not stretchy left square bracket i not stretchy right square bracket equals max invisible function application not stretchy left parenthesis d p not stretchy left square bracket i minus 1 not stretchy right square bracket comma p o i n t s not stretchy left square bracket i not stretchy right square bracket plus not stretchy left parenthesis d p not stretchy left square bracket i minus 2 not stretchy right square bracket text  if  end text i greater or equal than 2 text  else  end text 0 not stretchy right parenthesis not stretchy right parenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base cases:\n",
    "* dp[0] = points[0]\n",
    "* dp[1] = max(points[0], points[1]) if n >= 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints for Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a dynamic programming approach to build up the solution for each level.\n",
    "* You only need to keep track of the maximum points collected up to the previous level and the one before it, so you can optimize space usage if needed.\n",
    "* Think about what happens if you decide to play a particular level: you must skip the next, and then you are left with the problem starting from the next non-consecutive level.\n",
    "* Expected Solution Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Solution Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "* Space Complexity: O(n) (Can be optimized to O(1) by only storing the last two results)"
