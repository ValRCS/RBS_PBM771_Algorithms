    "# LLM - Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of deep learning models that are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate natural language text. These models are typically pre-trained on massive amounts of textual data to learn the underlying patterns, structures, and relationships in language. They are then fine-tuned on specific tasks, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, or question-answering, to achieve high performance with relatively little additional training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prominent examples of LLMs include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several factors that led to the creation of Large Language Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Availability of large-scale textual data: The explosion of digital text data on the internet and the development of large-scale text corpora enabled researchers to train models on diverse and extensive linguistic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advances in deep learning techniques: The development of novel neural network architectures, such as the Transformer, and improvements in optimization algorithms and unsupervised learning techniques allowed for more effective learning of complex language patterns and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computational power: The growth of computational resources, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized AI accelerators (e.g., TPUs), made it feasible to train larger models with millions or billions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transfer learning: The realization that pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks with relatively small amounts of labeled data led to a focus on developing more general and powerful language representations that could be"
