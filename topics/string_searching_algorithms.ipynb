    "# String Searching Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "String matching algorithms are algorithms that find all occurrences of a given pattern string in a text string. These algorithms have a wide range of applications, such as in text editing, data compression, and search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different string matching algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most commonly used algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Naive String Matching: This algorithm checks every substring of the text against the pattern, which is the simplest approach but also the least efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm: This algorithm uses the prefix function to avoid unnecessary comparisons of characters in the text string and the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Boyer-Moore Algorithm: This algorithm uses two preprocessing steps to speed up the matching process: a bad character rule and a good suffix rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rabin-Karp Algorithm: This algorithm uses hashing to check if the pattern matches a substring of the text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finite Automaton Algorithm: This algorithm uses a finite state machine to recognize the pattern in the text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms have different time and space complexities, and the choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of the application."

    "\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a string matching algorithm that uses two preprocessing steps to speed up the matching process: a bad character rule and a good suffix rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad character rule works by examining the character in text that caused the mismatch with pattern, and then shifting pattern so that the character in pattern that matches the bad character in text is aligned with the bad character in text. This can be done because we know that any occurrences of pattern in text that end at the index of the bad character in text cannot match due to the mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good suffix rule works by examining the longest suffix of pattern that matches a suffix of the current mismatch. If such a suffix exists, we can shift pattern so that the matching suffix is aligned with the mismatched suffix in text. This can be done because we know that any occurrences of pattern in text that end at the index of the mismatched suffix cannot match due to the mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore algorithm combines these two rules to determine the best shift to make after a mismatch occurs. Specifically, it chooses the larger of the shifts suggested by the bad character rule and the good suffix rule. This means that the algorithm skips over as many characters as possible in text before attempting another match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the Boyer-Moore algorithm is often faster than other string matching algorithms, particularly when the pattern string is long or there are many occurrences of the pattern in the text. However, it can be slower than other algorithms in certain cases, such as when the pattern string is short or there are few occurrences of the pattern in the text."
