    "The Two Sum problem is a common coding problem in computer programming. Given an array of integers and a target integer, the problem requires finding two numbers in the array that add up to the target integer. The solution to the problem involves finding the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following array of integers: [2, 7, 11, 15]. If the target integer is 9, then the solution to the Two Sum problem would be the indices of the two numbers that add up to 9, which are 0 and 1 (since 2 + 7 = 9).\n",

The hashing solution uses a hash table (dictionary in Python) to store the values in the input array as keys and their indices as values. This allows the solution to find the complement of each value in constant time on average, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n",

However, the time complexity of the two-pointer solution depends on the sorting algorithm used to sort the input array. If an efficient sorting algorithm is used, the time complexity can be O(n log n) in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the choice between the two solutions depends on the requirements of the specific problem. If space is not a concern and a fast solution is required, the hashing solution may be a better choice. If space is limited or the input array is already sorted, the two-pointer solution may be a better choice."
