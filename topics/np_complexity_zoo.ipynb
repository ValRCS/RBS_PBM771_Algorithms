    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity is a branch of computer science that studies the amount of resources (such as time and space) required to solve computational problems. Specifically, computational complexity theory seeks to classify problems according to their difficulty, and to understand the inherent limits of computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational complexity theory, problems are typically classified into different complexity classes based on the amount of resources required to solve them. For example, the class P contains problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and the class NP contains problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of computational complexity is important because it helps us understand which problems are tractable (solvable efficiently) and which problems are intractable (solvable only inefficiently). For example, some problems may require exponentially more time or space to solve as the size of the input increases, making them impractical to solve for large input sizes. Understanding the complexity of a problem is essential for developing efficient algorithms and for determining the practical limits of computing."

    "\n",
    "### P\n",
    "\n",
    "The class P contains problems that can be solved in polynomial time. A problem is in P if there is an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time. For example, the problem of multiplying two n × n matrices can be solved in O(n^3) time, so the problem is in P.\n",
    "\n",
    "P stands for \"polynomial time\". P problems are decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. Intuitively, this means that the time required to solve the problem grows at most polynomially with the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some more examples of P problems ->  those that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (i.e., problems that are in the class P):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sorting a list of n numbers: Given a list of n numbers, the problem is to rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. This can be done in O(n log n) time using algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers: Given two positive integers a and b, the problem is to find their largest positive integer divisor. This can be done in O(log min(a, b)) time using the Euclidean algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checking if a graph is bipartite: Given an undirected graph, the problem is to determine if it can be partitioned into two sets of vertices such that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent. This can be done in linear time (O(n + m)) using algorithms like breadth-first search or depth-first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph: Given a weighted graph, the problem is to find the shortest path between two vertices. This can be done in O(m log n) time using Dijkstra's algorithm or in O(m + n log n) time using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Testing whether a number is prime: Given a positive integer n, the problem is to determine whether it is prime. This can be done in O(sqrt(n)) time using algorithms like trial division or the Miller-Rabin test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class P is important because it contains many practical problems that can be efficiently solved by computers. In contrast, many interesting problems in NP are believed to be intractable for large inputs, meaning that their solution time grows exponentially with the size of the input. However, it's important to note that not all interesting problems are known to be in either P or NP."

For example, the decision version of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is the problem of determining whether there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph. The decision version of the knapsack problem is the problem of determining whether there exists a subset of items that has a total weight less than or equal to a given capacity. The decision version of the graph coloring problem is the problem of determining whether a given graph can be colored using at most k colors. The decision version of the subset sum problem is the problem of determining whether there exists a subset of numbers that has a total sum equal to a given target.\n"

    "What is P vs NP problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The P vs NP problem is perhaps the most famous open problem in computer science and mathematics. It asks whether every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (i.e., whether P = NP).\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, if P = NP, it would mean that all problems that can be verified in polynomial time (i.e., all problems in NP) can also be solved in polynomial time. This would have profound implications for many fields, including cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence. For example, if P = NP, then many encryption schemes used in online transactions would be vulnerable to attack, and some of the most difficult optimization problems in operations research could be solved efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite decades of research, no one has been able to prove whether P = NP or P ≠ NP. The prevailing belief among computer scientists and mathematicians is that P ≠ NP, but this remains an unsolved problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1 million prize for a proof of the P vs NP problem, which remains unclaimed.\n",

    "A deterministic Turing machine is a mathematical model of a computer that operates on an infinite tape divided into cells, each containing a symbol from a finite alphabet. The machine moves along the tape and reads and writes symbols according to a set of rules, called the transition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature of a deterministic Turing machine is that for any given input and current state, there is exactly one transition that the machine can take. That is, the next state of the machine and the symbol to be written on the tape are uniquely determined by the current state and the symbol being read.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deterministic behavior makes the model simple and easy to understand, and it is sufficient for many practical applications. However, there are some problems that cannot be efficiently solved by a deterministic Turing machine, even though they can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine. This is why the concept of a nondeterministic Turing machine is important in the study of computational complexity theory and the P vs NP problem.\n",

Like a deterministic Turing machine, a nondeterministic Turing machine is a mathematical model of a computer that operates on an infinite tape divided into cells, each containing a symbol from a finite alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between a nondeterministic Turing machine and a deterministic Turing machine is that a nondeterministic Turing machine can be in multiple states simultaneously, whereas a deterministic Turing machine can only be in one state at a time. This allows a nondeterministic Turing machine to explore multiple paths of computation in parallel, which can sometimes lead to exponential speedups in solving certain types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the P vs NP problem, the concept of a nondeterministic Turing machine is important because the definition of NP is based on the idea of a nondeterministic Turing machine. Specifically, a decision problem is in NP if it can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine, which can be thought of as exploring all possible solutions in parallel and verifying the correctness of one of them in polynomial time."

    "Informally, NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP, in the sense that if any one of them can be solved in polynomial time, then all problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time.

Many other important problems in computer science, such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the knapsack problem, and graph coloring, are also known to be NP-complete.\n",

    "NP-hardness is a useful concept in computational complexity theory because it allows us to compare the relative difficulty of different computational problems. For example, if we can show that a new problem is NP-hard, then we know that it is at least as hard as problems like the traveling salesman problem, the knapsack problem, and other well-known NP-hard problems.\n",

Rather, NP-hardness is a measure of the worst-case complexity of a problem, and is often used as a benchmark for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms and heuristics for solving the problem."
