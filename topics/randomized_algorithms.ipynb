        "Probabilistic analysis is a technique used in computer science to analyze algorithms that involve randomness or uncertainty. It involves using probability theory to calculate the expected behavior of an algorithm over many runs, rather than analyzing the behavior of a single run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Randomized algorithms, on the other hand, are algorithms that make use of random numbers or random choices to solve problems. They can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve deterministically, and they are often more efficient than their deterministic counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Probabilistic analysis is particularly useful for analyzing randomized algorithms, as it allows us to reason about the expected behavior of an algorithm over many runs. For example, if we run a randomized algorithm 100 times and observe that it gives the correct answer 95 times, we can use probabilistic analysis to calculate the probability that the algorithm will give the correct answer on any given run.\n",

To solve this problem, you decide to use an employment agency that will send you one candidate each day for an interview. You have to pay a small fee to the agency for each interview, and hiring an applicant is even more costly as it requires firing your current office assistant and paying a substantial hiring fee to the agency. Since you are committed to having the best possible person for the job, you have decided that if a candidate is more qualified than your current assistant, you will hire the new candidate and fire the current assistant. Although you are willing to pay the resulting cost, you want to estimate the price of this strategy."
