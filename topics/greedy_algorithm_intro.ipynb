        "Assume that you have an objective function that needs to be optimized (either maximized or minimized) at a given point. A Greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective function is optimized. The Greedy algorithm has only one shot to compute the optimal solution so that it never goes back and reverses the decision.\n",

        "\n",
        "* It is quite easy to come up with a greedy algorithm (or even multiple greedy algorithms) for a problem. Analyzing the run time for greedy algorithms will generally be much easier than for other techniques (like Divide and conquer). For the Divide and conquer technique, it is not clear whether the technique is fast or slow. This is because at each level of recursion the size of gets smaller and the number of sub-problems increases.\n",
        "* The difficult part is that for greedy algorithms you have to work much harder to understand correctness issues. Even with the correct algorithm, it is hard to prove why it is correct. Proving that a greedy algorithm is correct is more of an art than a science. It involves a lot of creativity. Usually, coming up with an algorithm might seem to be trivial, but proving that it is actually correct, is a whole different problem."

In the 0-1 knapsack, we have a given set of items, $i_1, i_2, ..., i_m$, that we can use to fill the knapsack. Again, the knapsack has a fixed capacity, and the items are associated with weights, $w_1, w_2, ..., w_m$, and values $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$. While our goal is still to pack the knapsack with a combination of items so that it carries the highest possible value, the 0-1 knapsack variation comes with the constraint that we can only carry 1 copy of each item. Thus, the runtime complexity of this algorithm is $O(nW)$, where $n$ is the number of items in the list and $W$ is the maximum capacity of the knapsack.\n",

In this case, the greedy algorithm has not found the globally optimal solution, which would be `'set_1'` and `'set_4'`. Note that this is just a trivial example, and greedy algorithms can be very useful approximators for solutions that are computationally infeasible.\n",

For example, a collection of 30 sets would already require comparing the solutions of $2^{30}=1,073,741,824$ million possible combinations!\n",
