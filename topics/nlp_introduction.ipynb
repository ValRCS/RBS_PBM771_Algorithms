    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is the study of how computers can understand, interpret and manipulate human language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NLP Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP combines computational techniques with linguistic knowledge to develop algorithms and models capable of processing human language effectively. Some of the core tasks and challenges in NLP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax analysis: Understanding the grammatical structure of sentences, which includes parsing and part-of-speech tagging.\n",
    "* Semantic analysis: Comprehending the meaning of words and sentences, including tasks such as word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, and named entity recognition.\n",
    "* Pragmatics: Interpreting the context in which language is used, such as understanding speaker intentions, resolving references, and identifying the relationships between sentences.\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as identifying whether a statement is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "* Machine translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another, taking into account linguistic nuances and cultural differences.\n",
    "* Text summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer documents, preserving the most important information.\n",
    "* Question-answering systems: Providing accurate and relevant answers to user questions based on the understanding of a corpus of text.\n",
    "* Dialogue systems: Developing conversational agents that can engage in natural and coherent interactions\n",
