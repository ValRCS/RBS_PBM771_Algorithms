    "# Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Invented by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford in 1950s, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm, but it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs with **negative** edge weights.\n",

    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by relaxing all the edges in the graph `|V| - 1` times, where `|V|` is the number of vertices in the graph. The relaxation process involves checking if the distance to a vertex `v` can be shortened by taking the edge `(u, v)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm also checks for negative cycles in the graph. A negative cycle is a cycle whose total weight is negative. If a negative cycle is found, the algorithm returns `False`, as the shortest path to some vertices is undefined."
