    "The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem is a well-known problem in computer science and graph theory. Given a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges, the MST problem requires finding the subgraph that connects all vertices of the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to find a tree that spans all vertices of the graph and has the minimum possible total weight.

    "Kruskal's algorithm is a popular greedy algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The algorithm works by iteratively adding edges to a subgraph, starting from an empty subgraph, until all vertices of the graph are included in the subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps of Kruskal's algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort all the edges in the graph in increasing order of their weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize an empty subgraph, which will eventually become the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Iterate through the sorted edges, and for each edge, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. If adding the edge to the subgraph does not create a cycle, add it to the subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. If adding the edge to the subgraph creates a cycle, discard it and move on to the next edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stop the iteration when all vertices are included in the subgraph, or when the subgraph contains n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return the subgraph, which is the MST of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kruskal's algorithm is relatively simple to implement and has a time complexity of O(E log E), where E is the number of edges in the graph. This makes it a very efficient algorithm for large graphs with many edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to implement step 3a is by using a disjoint-set data structure, which allows us to quickly determine whether adding an edge will create a cycle in the subgraph. By keeping track of the connected components of the subgraph, we can check whether two vertices are already connected before adding an edge between them."

    "The disjoint-set data structure, also known as a union-find data structure, is a way to efficiently represent a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It supports two operations: \"find\" and \"union\".\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the algorithm, each vertex is in its own subset. As we add edges to the subgraph, we perform a \"find\" operation on the vertices of each edge to determine which subsets they belong to. If the subsets are different, we can safely add the edge to the subgraph without creating a cycle, and then perform a \"union\" operation to merge the two subsets.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we explored three algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph: Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and Boruvka's algorithm. We also discussed Karger's algorithm, which is a linear time randomized algorithm for finding the MST of dense graphs.\n",
