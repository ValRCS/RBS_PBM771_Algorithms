        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "Minimal spanning tree (MST) is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem is a well-known problem in computer science and graph theory. Given a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges, the MST problem requires finding the subgraph that connects all vertices of the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, we want to find a tree that spans all vertices of the graph and has the minimum possible total weight. A tree is a connected acyclic graph, which means it is a graph that doesn't have any cycles (loops), and it is connected, which means that there is a path between any two vertices in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications of MST\n",
        "\n",
        "### Network design\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Electricity Grid design - The problem of designing an electricity grid that connects all houses in a city with the minimum possible total wire length can be modeled as an MST problem. This is the original motivation for the MST problem, as it was first introduced by the Czech scientist Otakar Borůvka in 1926 to solve this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Network cabling in a data center - The problem of connecting all servers in a data center with the minimum possible total cable length can be modeled as an MST problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Water supply network design - The problem of designing a water supply network that connects all houses in a city with the minimum possible total pipe length can be modeled as an MST problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considerations to think about in real life: What happens if a cable or pipe breaks? How can we ensure that the network remains connected even if some edges are removed?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Clustering\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Image processing - The problem of segmenting an image into regions with similar colors can be solved using clustering algorithms. The MST can be used to represent the relationships between pixels in the image, where the weight of an edge represents the similarity between two pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Document clustering - The problem of clustering documents based on their content can be solved using clustering algorithms. The MST can be used to represent the relationships between documents, where the weight of an edge represents the similarity between two documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Social Network Analysis - The problem of identifying communities in a social network can be solved using clustering algorithms. The MST can be used to represent the relationships between individuals in the social network, where the weight of an edge represents the strength of the relationship between two individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "So above problems are rather similar to the clustering problems, but the difference is that the MST is a tree, which means that it doesn't have any cycles, while clustering algorithms can produce clusters that are not trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approximation algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - The problem of finding the shortest possible tour that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city can be approximated using the MST. The MST can be used to construct a tour that visits all cities exactly once, but it may not be the shortest possible tour.\n",
        "\n",
        "MST will guarantee that the tour is connected and has the minimum possible total edge weight, but it may not be the shortest possible tour that visits all cities exactly once. However, the MST can be used as a starting point for more advanced approximation algorithms for the TSP.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Facility Location Problem - The problem of locating facilities such as warehouses or factories to serve a set of customers with the minimum possible total cost can be approximated using the MST. The MST can be used to identify the most important customers and locate facilities near them to minimize the total cost. It could be a supermarket chain trying to decide where to build new logistics centers to serve its stores.\n",
        "This could be called k-center (or k-median) problem, where we want to find the k centers that minimize the maximum distance between a customer and the nearest center.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Steiner tree problem - The problem of finding the shortest possible tree that connects a set of given points in a metric space can be approximated using the MST. The MST can be used to construct a tree that connects all given points, but it may not be the shortest possible tree that connects all points.\n",

        "Prim's algorithm: Prim's algorithm is another greedy algorithm that starts with a single vertex and iteratively adds the lowest-weight edge that connects a vertex in the current subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph, until all vertices are included in the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boruvka's algorithm: Boruvka's algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the graph into smaller subgraphs and finding the minimum-weight edge for each subgraph. It then merges the subgraphs by adding the minimum-weight edges found in the previous step.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Initialize an empty subgraph, which will eventually become the MST.\n",

        "a. If adding the edge to the subgraph does not create a cycle, add it to the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. If adding the edge to the subgraph creates a cycle, discard it and move on to the next edge.\n",
        "\n",

Most importantly adding, removing and checking whether an element is in the set can be done in O(1) time."

Like Kruskal's algorithm, it is a greedy algorithm that works by iteratively adding edges to a subgraph until all vertices of the graph are included in the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the steps of Prim's algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Choose an arbitrary vertex to start with and add it to the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. While not all vertices are in the subgraph, do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Identify the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Add the endpoint of the edge that is outside the subgraph to the subgraph.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Stop when all vertices are included in the subgraph, or when the subgraph contains n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Return the subgraph, which is the MST of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, Prim's algorithm starts with a single vertex and iteratively adds the lowest-weight edge that connects a vertex in the current subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph, until all vertices are included in the subgraph. This ensures that the subgraph is always connected, and because we choose the minimum-weight edges, it also guarantees that the subgraph is a tree, and therefore a valid MST of the original graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prim's algorithm can be implemented using a priority queue to efficiently find the edge with the minimum weight. At each iteration, we add the newly included vertex to the priority queue, and update the weights of the edges that connect it to vertices outside the subgraph. This allows us to efficiently find the minimum-weight edge in each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prim's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph and V is the number of vertices. This makes it an efficient algorithm for dense graphs with many edges, although it may not be as efficient as Kruskal's algorithm for sparse graphs."

        "There exists a linear time randomized algorithm to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem for dense graphs, which are graphs with many edges. This algorithm is called Karger's algorithm, which was developed by David Karger in 1993.\n",
        "\n",
        "Karger's algorithm works by iteratively contracting random edges in the graph until only two vertices remain. The contraction of an edge merges its two endpoints into a single vertex, and replaces the edges connecting the two endpoints with edges that connect the merged vertex to the other vertices. This process reduces the number of vertices in the graph, but it may introduce multiple edges and self-loops, which need to be handled correctly.\n",

        "Here are the steps of Karger's algorithm:\n",

        "The probability of Karger's algorithm producing the correct MST increases with the number of iterations. In fact, it can be shown that the algorithm has a success probability of at least 1/n^2, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, by running the algorithm multiple times, we can achieve a high probability of finding the correct MST.\n",
