    "# Exercise: Eco-Friendly Product Launch\n",
    "From: https://estudijas.rtu.lv/mod/assign/view.php?id=4116908\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're part of a European eco-friendly startup, Green Innovate EU, focusing on launching sustainable products. Your team is ready to introduce two new items: a biodegradable water bottle BIO_BOT and a solar-powered phone charger SOL_CHA. Both products align with the company's mission to reduce plastic waste and promote renewable energy sources. The challenge lies in maximizing profit while adhering to budget constraints and production capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Green Innovate EU has a budget of €50,000 for the first production run. The cost to produce one biodegradable water bottle is €3, and the cost for one solar-powered phone charger is €8. The expected profit from each water bottle is €5, and from each charger is €12. The market research team has indicated that due to the current market trends and consumer demand, the company should produce at least twice as many water bottles as chargers. Moreover, the production facility's constraints allow for the manufacture of a maximum of 10,000 water bottles and 4,000 chargers for this run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine how many of each product the startup should produce to maximize profit.\n",
    "Ensure that the production plan respects the budget limit, production capacity, and market demand insights.\n",
    "Requirements:\n",

    "Also you are allowed to try different approach, even some sort of brute-force solution.\n",
    "Also you are allowed to use pen and paper to solve this problem by hand and then verify solution.\n",
    "An interesting attempt would be to use some sort of hill-climbing approach."
