    "# Bipartite matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Bipartite matching is a classic problem in graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    " Given a bipartite graph, we want to find the maximum matching, which is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some real life examples of this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Assigning jobs to workers, where each worker can only do one job and each job can only be done by one worker.\n",
    "    - Assigning courses to students, where each student can only take one course and each course can only be taken by one student.\n",
    "    - Assigning tasks to machines, where each machine can only do one task and each task can only be done by one machine.\n",
    "    - Assigning rooms to guests, where each guest can only stay in one room and each room can only be occupied by one guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we will use to solve this problem is called the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. It is a very efficient algorithm that runs in O(sqrt(V) * E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph."
